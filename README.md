# basic_bitcoin_blockchain
A basic Bitcoin blockchain project includes: 1- Miners 2- Transaction pool 3- Mine 4- Block 5- Connecting nodes to each other and all the features of a currency with the pow algorithm


about project : 
I implemented the Bitcoin blockchain with Python.

It is on the level of a university project, not on the level of the real Bitcoin blockchain.

It has all the important parts of the blockchain, such as:
Network nodes + connecting nodes to each other + creating a block + mining a block with Nance + transaction pool + adding a transaction + finding a valid global chain

According to the Bitcoin algorithm, the chain that has produced the most blocks is valid, and as a result, the miner that produces the most blocks
determines the main chain.

The guide file is in Persian language. If you need help, you can send a message through social networks and I will translate the guide file into
English, Turkish, or Azeri.
